## 👋 Hi there, I’m Sravika!

I’m a Computer Science master’s student and software engineer who enjoys building practical, data-driven systems. I like working on problems where machine learning, backend engineering, and infrastructure come together to create something useful and reliable.

Most of my work focuses on applied machine learning, automation, and backend development — taking ideas from raw data to working systems. I care about clean design, measurable results, and building things that actually hold up beyond a demo.
